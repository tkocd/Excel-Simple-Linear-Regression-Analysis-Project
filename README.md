Linear Regression Analysis with Excel

In this project Excel's Add-in feature is used.

The main question is " How can height can predict weight? " 

Multiple R is the correlation coefficient between the two variables of interest. It is a value that tells you how strong the linear correlation between hight and weight is. It can get a value between 0 and 1. It is better to close to 1. In this example multiple R is equals to .502 we can say that it is not a 

R square is coefficient of determination value. It tells how much varience the dependent variable can be accounted for by the independent variable. When we multiply this value with 100, we can say that 25% of the varience in weight can be acoounted for by the height measures 75% of he varience is therefore caused by other factors such as measurement errors.

Adjusted R square takes into account the number of independent variables in the analysis and corrects for any bias.

Standart error of the regression is the average distance that the observed values are 10.07 kilograms from the regression line. The smaller the standart error, the more precise the linear regression model is.

Observation number is just basically number of the subjects.

On Anova table, "significance f" is the p value of the regression model. To be able to interpret this we need our hypothesis. Our null hypothesis is there is no linear relationship between the height and weight measures. Our alternative hypothesis is there is a linear relationship between the height and weight measures.
